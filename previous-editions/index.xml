      <description>Program  Forgery and Impersonation Attacks against of LINE&amp;rsquo;s End-to-End Encryption Schemes (Kazuhiko Minematsu) Count-then-Permute: a Precision-free Alternative to Inversion Sampling (Kentarou Sasaki) Improved (Almost) Tightly-Secure Structure-Preserving Signatures (Miyako Ohkubo)  Abstracts Forgery and Impersonation Attacks against of LINE&amp;rsquo;s End-to-End Encryption Schemes Kazuhiko Minematsu (NEC)
LINE is a mobile messaging application quite popular in Japan and several other east Asian countries. In this talk, we study the security of LINE&amp;rsquo;s End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) schemes, called Letter Sealing, by investigating the specifications described in the whitepaper published by the developer (the LINE corporation).</description>

      <description>Program  Encoding Predicates by Arithmetic Circuits and Its Applications (Shuich Katsumata) Threshold Cryptosystems From Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (Sam Kim) Notes On GGH13 Without The Presence Of Ideals (Alex Davidson) Constrained PRF for NC1 in Traditional Groups (Takashi Yamakawa)  Abstracts Encoding Predicates by Arithmetic Circuits and Its Applications Shuich Katsumata (The University of Tokyo)
Predicates are used in cryptography as a fundamental tool to control the disclosure of secrets.</description>

      <description>Program  From Single-Key to Collusion-Resistant Secret-Key Functional Encryption by Leveraging Succinctness (Fuyuki Kitagawa) Small CRT-Exponent RSA Revisited (Atsushi Takayasu) Privacy-Preserving Aggregation of Time-Series Data with Public Verifiability from Simple Assumptions (Keita Emura)  Abstracts From Single-Key to Collusion-Resistant Secret-Key Functional Encryption by Leveraging Succinctness Fuyuki Kitagawa (Tokyo Tech)
We show how to construct a secret-key functional encryption (SKFE) scheme that supports unbounded polynomially many functional decryption keys solely from an SKFE scheme that supports only one functional decryption key.</description>
