<p>LINE is a mobile messaging application quite popular in Japan and several other east Asian countries. In this talk, we study the security of LINE&rsquo;s End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) schemes, called Letter Sealing, by investigating the specifications described in the whitepaper published by the developer (the LINE corporation). While the purpose of E2EE is a protection of users from the potentially malicious server operated by the service provider (a.k.a E2E adversary), we report multiple practical attacks against Letter Sealing allowing forgery and impersonation by a malicious user colluding with E2E adversary, or in some cases even without involving E2E adversary. Our analysis shows that LINE&rsquo;s E2EE schemes do not satisfy the central security requirement for E2EE. We have informed our attacks to the developer, and they acknowledged those involving the E2E adversary.</p>

<p><strong>Kentrou Sasaki</strong> (NEC)</p>
<p>The sampling from a discrete probability distribution is an old and basic problem in computer science and has various applications. The inversion sampling is one of the most popular methods for this purpose. One drawback of inversion sampling (and the most of others) is that it&rsquo;s memory size and sampling speed depend on the required precision k. For cryptographic usage this can be problematic, because k can be quite high, e.g, 128 or 256 bits, or even more. For example, such situation occurs in the discrete Gaussian sampling in the lattice cryptography.</p>
<p>In this talk, we present a novel sampling method which we call counter-then-permute (CP) sampler. It is a generic sampler for arbitrary discrete distribution and has a unique feature that it&rsquo;s time and memory for on-line sampling is completely precision-free but depends on the maximum number of samples we need, written as N . Therefore, it can be faster and require smaller memory than inversion sampling depending on the parameters, k and N. Our proposal consists of a novel use of a block cipher as an efficient, computationally-secure instantiation of uniform sampling with replacement, and the use of recent works on exact sublinear sampling for large binomial distributions. We also present implementations and experimental evaluations of our CP sampler, taking our target as discrete Gaussian distributions employed by the known lattice cryptographic schemes.</p>

<p>Structure Preserving Signatures (SPS) allow the signatures and the messages signed to be further encrypted while retaining the ability to be proven valid under zero-knowledge. In particular, SPS are tailored to have structure suitable for Groth-Sahai NIZK proofs. More precisely, the messages, signatures, and verification keys are required to be elements of groups that support efficient bilinear-pairings (bilinear groups), and the signature verification consists of just evaluating one or more bilinear-pairing product equations. Since Groth-Sahai NIZK proofs can (with zero-knowledge) prove the validity of such pairing product equations, it leads to interesting applications such as blind signatures, group signatures, traceable signatures, group encryption, and delegatable credential systems.</p>
<p>In this paper, we further improve on the SPS scheme of Abe, Hofheinz, Nishimaki, Ohkubo and Pan (CRYPTO 2017) while maintaining only an O(λ)-factor security reduction loss to the SXDH assumption. In particular, we compress the size of the signatures by almost 40%, and reduce the number of pairing-product equations in the verifier from fifteen to seven. Recall that structure preserving signatures are used in applications by encrypting the messages and/or the signatures, and hence these optimizations are further amplified as proving pairing-product equations in Groth-Sahai NIZK system is not frugal. While our scheme uses an important novel technique introduced by Hofheinz (EuroCrypt 2017), i.e. structure-preserving adaptive partitioning, our approach to building the signature scheme is different and this leads to the optimizations mentioned. Thus we make progress towards an open problem stated by Abe et al. (CRYPTO 2017) to design more compact SPS-es with smaller number of group elements.</p>
