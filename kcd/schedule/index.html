<h3 id="extracting-randomness-from-extractor-dependent-sources">Extracting Randomness from Extractor-Dependent Sources</h3>

<p><strong>Daniel Wichs</strong> (NTT Research Inc.)</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit the well-studied problem of extracting nearly uniform randomness from an arbitrary source of sufficient min-entropy. Strong seeded extractors solve this problem by relying on a public random seed, which is unknown to the source. Here, we consider a setting where the seed is reused over time  and the source may depend on prior calls to the extractor with the same seed. Can we still extract nearly uniform randomness? In more detail, we assume the seed is chosen randomly, but the source can make arbitrary oracle queries to the extractor with the given seed before outputting a sample. We require that the sample has entropy and differs from any of the previously queried values. The extracted output should look uniform even to a distinguisher that gets the seed. We  provide constructions and lower bounds for extractors in this setting.</p>

<h3 id="finding-collisions-in-a-quantum-world-quantum-black-box-separation-of-collision-resistance-and-one-wayness">Finding Collisions in a Quantum World: Quantum Black-Box Separation of Collision-Resistance and One-Wayness</h3>

<p><strong>Takashi Yamakawa</strong> (NTT Secure Platform Laboratories)</p>

<p>Abstract: Since the celebrated work of Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC 1989), a number of black-box impossibility results have been established. However, these works only ruled out classical black-box reductions among cryptographic primitives. Therefore it may be possible to overcome these impossibility results by using quantum reductions. To exclude such a possibility, we have to extend these impossibility results to the quantum setting. In this paper, we initiate the study of black-box impossibility in the quantum setting. We first formalize a quantum counterpart of fully-black-box reduction following the formalization by Reingold, Trevisan and Vadhan (TCC 2004). Then we prove that there is no quantum fully-black-box reduction from collision-resistant hash functions to one-way permutations (or even trapdoor permutations). We take both of classical and quantum implementations of primitives into account. This is an extension to the quantum setting of the work of Simon (Eurocrypt 1998) who showed a similar result in the classical setting.</p>

<h3 id="compact-nizks-from-standard-assumptions-on-bilinear-maps">Compact NIZKs from Standard Assumptions on Bilinear Maps</h3>

<p><strong>Ryo Nishimaki</strong> (NTT Secure Platoform Laboratories)</p>

<p>Abstract: A non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) protocol enables a prover to convince a verifier of the truth of a statement without leaking any other information by sending a single message. The main focus of this work is on exploring short pairing-based NIZKs for all NP languages based on standard assumptions. In this regime, the seminal work of Groth, Ostrovsky, and Sahai (J.ACM&rsquo;12) (GOS-NIZK) is still considered to be the state-of-the-art. Although fairly efficient, one drawback of GOS-NIZK is that the proof size is <strong>multiplicative</strong> in the circuit size computing the NP relation. That is, the proof size grows by $O(|C|k)$, where $C$ is the circuit for the NP relation and $k$ is the security parameter.
By now, there have been numerous follow-up works focusing on shortening the proof size of pairing-based NIZKs, however, thus far, all works come at the cost of relying either on a non-standard knowledge-type assumption or a non-static $q$-type assumption.
Specifically, improving the proof size of the original GOS-NIZK under the same standard assumption has remained as an open problem.</p>

<p>Our main result is a construction of a pairing-based NIZK for all of NP whose proof size is <strong>additive</strong> in $|C|$, that is, the proof size only grows by $|C| +\poly(k)$, based on the decisional linear (DLIN) assumption. Since the DLIN assumption is the same assumption underlying GOS-NIZK, our NIZK is a strict improvement on their proof size.</p>

<p>The main building block for all of our NIZKs is a constrained signature scheme with <strong>decomposable online-offline efficiency</strong>. This is a property which we newly introduce in this paper and construct from the DLIN assumption. We believe this construction is of an independent interest.</p>
