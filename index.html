<p><strong><a name="KMinematsu">Forgery and Impersonation Attacks against of LINE's End-to-End Encryption Schemes
</a></strong><br/>
<em>Kazuhiko Minematsu</em> (NEC)</p>
<p>LINE is a mobile messaging application quite popular in Japan and several other east Asian countries. 
In this talk, we study the security of LINE's End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) schemes, 
called Letter Sealing, by investigating the specifications described in the whitepaper 
published by the developer (the LINE corporation). 
While the purpose of E2EE is a protection of users from the potentially malicious server operated 
by the service provider (a.k.a E2E adversary), we report multiple practical attacks against Letter Sealing 
allowing forgery and impersonation by a malicious user colluding with E2E adversary, or in some cases 
even without involving E2E adversary. 
Our analysis shows that LINE's E2EE schemes do not satisfy the central security requirement for E2EE. 
We have informed our attacks to the developer, and they acknowledged those involving the E2E adversary.

<p><strong><a name="KSasaki">Count-then-Permute: a Precision-free Alternative to Inversion Sampling</a></strong>
 <!-- &raquo; <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/092">eprint</a> -->

<em>Kentrou Sasaki</em> (NEC)</p>
<p>The sampling from a discrete probability distribution is an old and basic
problem in computer science and has various applications.
The inversion sampling is one of the most popular methods for this purpose.
One drawback of inversion sampling (and the most of others) is that
it's memory size and sampling speed depend on the required precision $k$. 
For cryptographic usage this can be problematic, because 
$k$ can be quite high, e.g, 128 or 256 bits, or even more. 
For example, such situation occurs in the discrete Gaussian sampling in 
the lattice cryptography. 
In this talk, we present a novel sampling method which we call
counter-then-permute (CP) sampler. It is a generic sampler for arbitrary
discrete distribution and has a unique feature that it's time and memory
for on-line sampling is completely precision-free but depends on the 
maximum number of samples we need, written as $N$ . 
Therefore, it can be faster and require smaller memory than inversion 
sampling depending on the parameters, $k$ and $N$. 
Our proposal consists of a novel use of a block cipher as an efficient, 
computationally-secure instantiation of uniform sampling with replacement, 
and the use of recent works on exact sublinear sampling for 
large binomial distributions.
We also present implementations and experimental evaluations of our CP
sampler, taking our target as discrete Gaussian distributions employed by 
 the known lattice cryptographic schemes. </p>

<p><strong><a name="MOhkubo">Improved (Almost) Tightly-Secure Structure-Preserving Signatures</a></strong><br/>
<em>Miyako Ohkubo</em> (NICT)</p>
<p>
Structure Preserving Signatures (SPS) allow the signatures
and the messages signed to be further encrypted while retaining the
ability to be proven valid under zero-knowledge. In particular, SPS are
tailored to have structure suitable for Groth-Sahai NIZK proofs. More
precisely, the messages, signatures, and verification keys are required to
be elements of groups that support efficient bilinear-pairings (bilinear
groups), and the signature verification consists of just evaluating one or
more bilinear-pairing product equations. Since Groth-Sahai NIZK proofs
can (with zero-knowledge) prove the validity of such pairing product
equations, it leads to interesting applications such as blind signatures,
group signatures, traceable signatures, group encryption, and delegatable
credential systems.
In this paper, we further improve on the SPS scheme of Abe, Hofheinz,
Nishimaki, Ohkubo and Pan (CRYPTO 2017) while maintaining only an
O(Î»)-factor security reduction loss to the SXDH assumption. In particular,
we compress the size of the signatures by almost 40%, and reduce
the number of pairing-product equations in the verifier from fifteen to
seven. Recall that structure preserving signatures are used in applications
by encrypting the messages and/or the signatures, and hence these
optimizations are further amplified as proving pairing-product equations
in Groth-Sahai NIZK system is not frugal. While our scheme uses an
important novel technique introduced by Hofheinz (EuroCrypt 2017),
i.e. structure-preserving adaptive partitioning, our approach to building
the signature scheme is different and this leads to the optimizations mentioned.
Thus we make progress towards an open problem stated by Abe
et al. (CRYPTO 2017) to design more compact SPS-es with smaller
number of group elements.
